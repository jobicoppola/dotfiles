# JIRA CLI

This directory contains basically just a starter pack for using:

[go-jira](https://github.com/go-jira/jira)

which is a Jira command line tool.  Here we are simply providing some custom
templates and commands to help anyone who would prefer to use cli instead of
the browser to manage their Jira tickets.

# Installation

First install `go` and `go-jira`:

* macOS: `brew install go-jira`
* Windows: install binaries for [go](https://golang.org/dl/) and
  [go-jira](https://github.com/go-jira/jira/releases)
* Linux: `[apt-get|yum] install golang` and then install binary for
  [go-jira](https://github.com/go-jira/jira/releases)

# Configuration

You can clone this repository to `~/.jira.d` or clone it wherever you want and
sync it into `~/.jira.d`.  Copy:

`config.example.yml` to `~/.jira.d/config.yml`

If you want tab completion, after installing `go-jira`, simply add the
following to your shell config (e.g. `~/.bashrc`):

    eval "$(jira --completion-script-bash)"

* `usage: jira [<flags>] <command> [<args> ...]`
